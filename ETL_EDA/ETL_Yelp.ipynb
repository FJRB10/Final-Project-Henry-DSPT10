cheesesteak. We picked the top 5 yelp locations, went to each one on concession, ordered exactly the same item at each place (cheesesteak with Provolone cheese and grilled onions), split it in 4 and gave our verdict. Findings as follows (in order of preference):\\n\\n#1 - Sonny's: soft bread, delicious cheese and flavorful meat. Our absolute fave. Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect.\\n\\n#2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier.\\n\\n#3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent.\\n\\n#4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice. \\n\\n#5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip.\\n\\nHopefully our little taste testing endeavor will help anyone visiting Philly for a brief time, looking to try the best cheesesteaks this city has to offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             5\n","Both Christmas gifts that we ordered were shipped to two different family members out of state were NOT the items I purchased. When I reached out to Maria Crespo, I was asked for \"proof\" of wrong items and wanted the recipient(s) to send detailed pictures of the gift they received. This is NOT how mistakes should be handled. I am NOT asking my family to take pictures of their GIFTS and I will NEVER order from you again.  Buyer beware and your customer service sucks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n","While my family and I visited Philadelphia, we wanted to enrich ourselves with the taste of as a local would. After much research of which were the best Philly Cheesesteak locations, we decided to stay away from the tourist traps of Genos and Pats. Although these two locations were recommend for the rivalry experience, we choose taste over an atmosphere experience. So we went to Dalessandro's, Jim's Steaks, Woodrow's Sandwiches, and Tony Lukes. \\n\\nWe started by going to Dalessandro's Steaks on our arrival on a Saturday night around 8. The place was packed and the line was out the door. This looked good.\\n\\nYou walk into the building finding that most people have already ordered and the line is just people waiting for their order. You shimmy your way through the people to get up to someone who takes your order and name. You pay when you pick up, CASH ONLY, the cost was about $9 a sandwich. Then you wait for your name to be called.\\n\\nNot having anywhere to eat, we returned to our car which was parked across the street and down a little bit in a gravel parking lot for the park.\\n\\nExpecting this food to be the best I've ever eaten, I was ready. My mouth watering and waiting to accept nothing but goodness......and then.......disappointment. Wow, was not expecting that.\\n\\nThe bread was soft and good. We order provolone, with onions. We could not really taste the cheese at all, which was a disappointment. The meat however was packed into the sandwich, but was very greasy and soaked the bottom of the bread in greasy drippings. I ended up pulling the onions off because they did not add the right flavor or texture for some reason. I'm not sure if it was just a bad onion or someone else. I do wish we got one provolone and one whiz. My little one got a cheese burger which he really enjoyed which is a positive for what a picky eater he is. It was gone even before I could try a bite to review. I left feeling that if this was the best Philly had to offer, maybe I did not like Cheesesteaks. My wife, a Cheesesteak connoisseur, commented that she preferred Jersey Mike's cheesesteak over Dalessandro's. Since I planned this Cheesesteak trip for her, I felt defeated. \\n\\nOur next stop was Jim's Steaks. When we walked in at lunch time on a Monday and it 5 people were inside, I became worried again that I may have made a mistake. We ordered one with provolone with peppers and one with whiz and onions. We also ordered an Italian Hoagie for my little one.\\n\\nWe found there was additional seating upstairs, which only had 1 table left. I felt a little better at this point about my selection, then I took a bite.....Wow, what a difference, redemption. The bread was amazing for both the cheesesteak and the hoagie. The steak was cooked to perfection, no fat, and no grease. The bread stayed nice and dry besides the generous helping of cheese. They apply cheese on the bottom and onto of the sandwich making sure it was fully of cheesey goodness. The peppers were good, having a sweet taste. \\n\\nThe whiz and onions, definitely the way to go. Wow, I could not get enough of it. Knowing we still had another stop and another Cheesesteak to go, I found it really hard to not go back for a full sandwich (my family of 4 split the 3 sandwiches). The Italian hoagie, was just as flavorful for someone who does not like Cheesesteak, like my little one. However, I must note, that even my picky little one liked the Cheesesteak whiz with. The sandwiches here cost $8, $9 with cheese, CASH ONLY.\\n\\nWoodrow's Sandwiches was a little bit different. Here they make their own whiz, which is made with truffle oil. The cost is $12, so it is a bit more expensive. The sandwich itself was packed full of flavor. The truffle oil whiz definitely brought another flavor element to the table, which elevated the sandwich. The steak however was greasy and left the bread soaked at the bottom of grease. The staff was very friendly and helpful, even recommending other locations to try Cheesesteaks on our tour.\\n\\nTony Luke's - The bread was decent, but not as good as the other three locations. We ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and onions. The steak was not as tender as the other 3 locations and was in much larger pieces instead of your typical diced cut. The meat was also very greasy, dripping all over while eating it. The onions were barley cooked, leaving a heavy onion taste and the whiz was nothing too special. The cost was $10. \\n\\nIf you are trying to decide where to go, I would go to Jim's Steaks followed by Woodrow's. I would stay way from Dalessandro's and try a different location all together after Jim's and Woodrow's. Tony's was ok, better than Dalessandro's, but still worlds apart from Jim's and Woodrow's. \\n\\nIn my opinion, if your looking for the best local Cheesesteak, I would go with Jims. If your looking for the best Cheesesteak that has a unique flavor, I would go with Woodrow's. If you want to try two good but differnt styles of Cheesesteak, stick with Jim's and Woodrows.    4\n","good experience！Nice environment and my server jason is best,I will come back Next time

I am a regular at Philips. I religiously eat Philips. I choose Philips over Pats, Genos, Tony Luke's, and any other corner store or pizzeria that sells cheesesteak. I eat here when I'm sober, and especially when I'm drunk.\\n\\nSo I just ordered a cheesesteak, half wiz half provolone. \\n\\nI told her I wanted half of it to have wiz and the other half to have provolone. \\n\\nI'm not sure where the communication fell apart, but I only received the cheesesteak with provolone on one side and the other side with no cheese. My girlfriend called back to make them aware of what happened and she told me they would cook us a new one, which I thought was fair. Unfortunately, we were already on 95 north to NE so I figure it would make more sense if I called back to just redeem it a different day. The lady I served picked up and told me she couldn't cook me a new one. I would have to come back and get more wiz if I wanted one. She said it was my fault. She repeated what I wanted... Asking if I wanted cheese on both side or something. To be honest, I'm not sure what she asked me, but regardless of her argument... It was clear that I said half provolone half wiz.\\n\\nWhere's the wiz?\\n\\nI'm not petty. I'm not anal. I'm not the type to hold grudges. But if the one thing I cannot stand is when I'm being blamed for someone else's\\nMistake... Especially when it's the person blaming me.\\n\\nGreat customer service!\\n\\nTime to start going to Pats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2\n","I really wanted to like this place, especially after reading all of the good reviews prior to trying it out. What a strange experience. I ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were just okay. It was basically two or three regular size spring rolls except they sliced them all in half diagonally - I guess to make it seem like you were getting more. Anyway, I got the chicken Pad Thai as my entree. I'm a big fan of Pad Thai and have had it many times in many different places but never tasted anything close to what they served me. It tasted like a big bowl of spaghetti squash (strange I know), however the chicken was alright and turned out to be the only thing I could stomach. \\n\\nThe service was super awkward and inattentive, however I want to be clear that the employees were not rude or unprofessional, just.....awkward. They didn't really seem like they knew where to seat me when I walked in, and then gave me what looked like a take out menu after I was seated at the bar. There were maybe 5 or 6 people in the restaurant at the time. \\nMost likely won't be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n","Made the trip from CT primarily to taste the legends and make the comparison of the two proverbial giants of the Philly Cheesesteak scene, Geno's and Pat's. Did the classic 'Whiz Wit' at each and while neither was anything that absolutely blew me away in taste alone, I won't be driving past without stopping anytime soon. Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star. \\n\\nIn the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two. \\n\\nFrom the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz.  The combination works well and IMO that is why they're here. It'd be a regular stop if I lived anywhere close by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2\n","Here's a gimmick that will win me over every time: drizzled honey on a hot, steaming pizza pie.\\n\\nNomad got the memo and our decision couldn't have been easier - the Spicy Soppressata. There's just something about mixing sausage grease and zesty garlic with sweet honey that speaks to me. I mean, the milky fresh mozzarella and soft, yet slightly charred dough certainly never hurt either, but that's to be expected on most pies of this caliber. Even though Nomad's pizza could be considered Neapolitan \"wet\", ironically, the tomato sauce was noticeably still too thin and watery. Other than that, this Spicy Soppressata pick was excellent. \\n\\nOur waitress assured us that their pizzas were single-serve, but I'm tellin' you, that's aggressive. Even the most ambitious of eaters at our group dinner reluctantly had leftovers. I split the pie with my wife, after ordering a special salad to share as well, and that seemed to be perfect for us. It was a Woodfired Roasted Corn Salad, employing oranges, avocado, cherry tomatoes, shallots, jalapeños, and fava beans - a nice, refreshing, summery teaser before our spicy, sausage-y main course.\\n\\nAlso refreshing and recommended, if available, is their special Spiked Shandy Beer Cocktail. Nomad's take on the ale and lemonade favorite uses St. Germaine, tequila, (you guessed it) honey, and (you probably didn't guess it) honey-flavored Shawnee Apiarius beer. Despite this onslaught of alcohols, it was decidedly smooth.\\n\\nNow, I know it's summer and sometimes it's nice to keep all the doors open to catch a breeze, but Nomad was hot as balls inside - hotter than outside given how central the wood-burning store is to the dining room. I think you can see by my praise for everything we ate that we eventually got over it, but it's still something worth noting if you're prone to the meat sweats (or even the regular sweats). Again, as for hot honey on a hot sausage pie? Well, that's some heat I can handle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n","This place is crowded as hell.

We picked the top 5 yelp locations, went to each one on concession, ordered exactly the same item at each place (cheesesteak with Provolone cheese and grilled onions), split it in 4 and gave our verdict. Findings as follows (in order of preference):\\n\\n#1 - Sonny's: soft bread, delicious cheese and flavorful meat. Our absolute fave. Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect.\\n\\n#2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier.\\n\\n#3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent.\\n\\n#4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice. \\n\\n#5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip.\\n\\nHopefully our little taste testing endeavor will help anyone visiting Philly for a brief time, looking to try the best cheesesteaks this city has to offer.</th>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Both Christmas gifts that we ordered were shipped to two different family members out of state were NOT the items I purchased.

After much research of which were the best Philly Cheesesteak locations, we decided to stay away from the tourist traps of Genos and Pats. Although these two locations were recommend for the rivalry experience, we choose taste over an atmosphere experience. So we went to Dalessandro's, Jim's Steaks, Woodrow's Sandwiches, and Tony Lukes. \\n\\nWe started by going to Dalessandro's Steaks on our arrival on a Saturday night around 8. The place was packed and the line was out the door. This looked good.\\n\\nYou walk into the building finding that most people have already ordered and the line is just people waiting for their order. You shimmy your way through the people to get up to someone who takes your order and name. You pay when you pick up, CASH ONLY, the cost was about $9 a sandwich. Then you wait for your name to be called.\\n\\nNot having anywhere to eat, we returned to our car which was parked across the street and down a little bit in a gravel parking lot for the park.\\n\\nExpecting this food to be the best I've ever eaten, I was ready. My mouth watering and waiting to accept nothing but goodness......and then.......disappointment. Wow, was not expecting that.\\n\\nThe bread was soft and good. We order provolone, with onions. We could not really taste the cheese at all, which was a disappointment. The meat however was packed into the sandwich, but was very greasy and soaked the bottom of the bread in greasy drippings. I ended up pulling the onions off because they did not add the right flavor or texture for some reason. I'm not sure if it was just a bad onion or someone else. I do wish we got one provolone and one whiz. My little one got a cheese burger which he really enjoyed which is a positive for what a picky eater he is. It was gone even before I could try a bite to review. I left feeling that if this was the best Philly had to offer, maybe I did not like Cheesesteaks. My wife, a Cheesesteak connoisseur, commented that she preferred Jersey Mike's cheesesteak over Dalessandro's. Since I planned this Cheesesteak trip for her, I felt defeated. \\n\\nOur next stop was Jim's Steaks. When we walked in at lunch time on a Monday and it 5 people were inside, I became worried again that I may have made a mistake. We ordered one with provolone with peppers and one with whiz and onions. We also ordered an Italian Hoagie for my little one.\\n\\nWe found there was additional seating upstairs, which only had 1 table left. I felt a little better at this point about my selection, then I took a bite.....Wow, what a difference, redemption. The bread was amazing for both the cheesesteak and the hoagie. The steak was cooked to perfection, no fat, and no grease. The bread stayed nice and dry besides the generous helping of cheese. They apply cheese on the bottom and onto of the sandwich making sure it was fully of cheesey goodness. The peppers were good, having a sweet taste. \\n\\nThe whiz and onions, definitely the way to go. Wow, I could not get enough of it. Knowing we still had another stop and another Cheesesteak to go, I found it really hard to not go back for a full sandwich (my family of 4 split the 3 sandwiches). The Italian hoagie, was just as flavorful for someone who does not like Cheesesteak, like my little one. However, I must note, that even my picky little one liked the Cheesesteak whiz with. The sandwiches here cost $8, $9 with cheese, CASH ONLY.\\n\\nWoodrow's Sandwiches was a little bit different. Here they make their own whiz, which is made with truffle oil. The cost is $12, so it is a bit more expensive. The sandwich itself was packed full of flavor. The truffle oil whiz definitely brought another flavor element to the table, which elevated the sandwich. The steak however was greasy and left the bread soaked at the bottom of grease. The staff was very friendly and helpful, even recommending other locations to try Cheesesteaks on our tour.\\n\\nTony Luke's - The bread was decent, but not as good as the other three locations. We ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and onions. The steak was not as tender as the other 3 locations and was in much larger pieces instead of your typical diced cut. The meat was also very greasy, dripping all over while eating it. The onions were barley cooked, leaving a heavy onion taste and the whiz was nothing too special. The cost was $10. \\n\\nIf you are trying to decide where to go, I would go to Jim's Steaks followed by Woodrow's. I would stay way from Dalessandro's and try a different location all together after Jim's and Woodrow's. Tony's was ok, better than Dalessandro's, but still worlds apart from Jim's and Woodrow's. \\n\\nIn my opinion, if your looking for the best local Cheesesteak, I would go with Jims. If your looking for the best Cheesesteak that has a unique flavor, I would go with Woodrow's. If you want to try two good but differnt styles of Cheesesteak, stick with Jim's and Woodrows.</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>good experience！Nice environment and my server jason is best,I will come back Next time</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>I'm so disappointed right now.

My girlfriend called back to make them aware of what happened and she told me they would cook us a new one, which I thought was fair. Unfortunately, we were already on 95 north to NE so I figure it would make more sense if I called back to just redeem it a different day. The lady I served picked up and told me she couldn't cook me a new one. I would have to come back and get more wiz if I wanted one. She said it was my fault. She repeated what I wanted... Asking if I wanted cheese on both side or something. To be honest, I'm not sure what she asked me, but regardless of her argument... It was clear that I said half provolone half wiz.\\n\\nWhere's the wiz?\\n\\nI'm not petty. I'm not anal. I'm not the type to hold grudges.

What a strange experience. I ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were just okay. It was basically two or three regular size spring rolls except they sliced them all in half diagonally - I guess to make it seem like you were getting more. Anyway, I got the chicken Pad Thai as my entree. I'm a big fan of Pad Thai and have had it many times in many different places but never tasted anything close to what they served me. It tasted like a big bowl of spaghetti squash (strange I know), however the chicken was alright and turned out to be the only thing I could stomach. \\n\\nThe service was super awkward and inattentive, however I want to be clear that the employees were not rude or unprofessional, just.....awkward. They didn't really seem like they knew where to seat me when I walked in, and then gave me what looked like a take out menu after I was seated at the bar. There were maybe 5 or 6 people in the restaurant at the time. \\nMost likely won't be back.</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Made the trip from CT primarily to taste the legends and make the comparison of the two proverbial giants of the Philly Cheesesteak scene, Geno's and Pat's.

Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star. \\n\\nIn the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two. \\n\\nFrom the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz.

There's just something about mixing sausage grease and zesty garlic with sweet honey that speaks to me. I mean, the milky fresh mozzarella and soft, yet slightly charred dough certainly never hurt either, but that's to be expected on most pies of this caliber. Even though Nomad's pizza could be considered Neapolitan \"wet\", ironically, the tomato sauce was noticeably still too thin and watery. Other than that, this Spicy Soppressata pick was excellent. \\n\\nOur waitress assured us that their pizzas were single-serve, but I'm tellin' you, that's aggressive. Even the most ambitious of eaters at our group dinner reluctantly had leftovers. I split the pie with my wife, after ordering a special salad to share as well, and that seemed to be perfect for us. It was a Woodfired Roasted Corn Salad, employing oranges, avocado, cherry tomatoes, shallots, jalapeños, and fava beans - a nice, refreshing, summery teaser before our spicy, sausage-y main course.\\n\\nAlso refreshing and recommended, if available, is their special Spiked Shandy Beer Cocktail. Nomad's take on the ale and lemonade favorite uses St. Germaine, tequila, (you guessed it) honey, and (you probably didn't guess it) honey-flavored Shawnee Apiarius beer. Despite this onslaught of alcohols, it was decidedly smooth.\\n\\nNow, I know it's summer and sometimes it's nice to keep all the doors open to catch a breeze, but Nomad was hot as balls inside - hotter than outside given how central the wood-burning store is to the dining room. I think you can see by my praise for everything we ate that we eventually got over it, but it's still something worth noting if you're prone to the meat sweats (or even the regular sweats). Again, as for hot honey on a hot sausage pie? Well, that's some heat I can handle.</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>This place is crowded as hell.
